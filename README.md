**Project Title: Real-Time Chat Application**
Tech Stack: Spring Boot, WebSocket, Java, Maven

**Description:**
This project is a real-time chat application built using Spring Boot and WebSocket. It allows users to send and receive messages instantly in a chat room without needing to refresh the page

**Key Features:**
Real-time messaging using WebSocket
Create and join chat rooms
Simple and clean user interface
Backend API to manage rooms and messages
Bi-directional communication between client and server

**Note:**-
I made this project as part of my college group project. I was responsible for the complete backend part.
To test the APIs, I used the Postman tool to check if they were working correctly as Client or Frontend part.
I used MongoDB to store messages so that data stays safe and the chat works in real time.
